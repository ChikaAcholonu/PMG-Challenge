## PMG Challenge - CSV-Combiner

This is a program to combine several csv files found in a selected path. 
It will also indicate which csv file a row belongs to in the 1st column. 
This program will require you to manually add in some values that fit your need. 
You would be required to type in the path to your csv files and also to type a name to label the csv source file of each row in the new combined list
